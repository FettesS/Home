	        <h1 id= "Top"> Overview </h1> 
		<p> Dating back as early as the 1400s, the guitar has been a staple instrument for a variety of 
		musical genres. With its iconic look and sound, it is one of the most versatile instruments in the 
		world. Compared to the rest of the string instrument family , the guitar is rather unique. Though 
		it may share a relatively similar design with other string instruments, it is used in very 
		different roles. While the other instruments of the family like the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin">
		violin </a> and <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello"> cello </a> are mostly 
		found in orchestral music, the guitar is found in a vast variety of <a href="#GuitarRoles"> music 
		forms </a> ranging from classical to rock and roll. The guitar also features a multitude of 
		<a href= "GuitarTechniques.html"> playing techniques.</a> </p> 
		<h2 id="GuitarAnatomy"> Anatomy of the Guitar </h2>
		<p> As is the case with all instruments, the guitar is made up of many parts that all come together 
		in a very particular way to create the instrument. The guitar is no exception to this trend, 
		it is a finely crafted instrument with very precise requirements and measurements.
		The acoustic guitar is a wooden instrument
		that has 6 steel strings stretching along a long wooden panel called the neck. The neck of the 
		average acoustic steel string guitar stretches for approximately 24 inches. The neck is divided
		into 24 frets. Each set of 12 frets accounts for 1 octave of the guitar. On most guitars, only the 
		first 12 frets are accessible. However, some guitars may feature a "cut-in." Cut-ins are when a 
		guitar is built with a section of the body removed so that the player can move their hand farther 
		up the fretboard and access all 24 frets. At the top of the neck is the headstock. On the headstock 
		is where the strings' tuning pegs are found. These pegs allow for each string to be tuned
		individually by tightening the string (raising the pitch), or loosening the string (lowering the 
		pitch). Once a string begins to vibrate, the sound is magnified by the hollow wooden or solid plastic body 
		of the guitar. The sound produced is projected out of the body through a hole called the sound hole.
		The sound hole is found at the opposite end of the fretboard as the headstock. While
		most guitars are made with solid pieces of wood, some learner's guitars are built with
		thin layers of plywood that have been glued together.  More general information
		about guitars can be found at <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar"> Wikipedia's page </a> 
		on guitars. </p>  	
		<h2 id="GuitarTypes"> Types of Guitars </h2> 
		<p> To accommodate for its large variety of roles in music, the guitar also comes in a variety of 
		types, each one having its own unique sound and feel. The types are as follows: </p> 
		<ul>

		    <li> <a href= "#bassguitars"> Bass Guitars </a> </li> 
		</ul> 
		<h3 id="acousticguitars"> Acoustic guitars </h3> 
		<p> Acoustic guitars are the type of guitar most commonly found playing lead roles in country,
		or pop music. These guitars produce a warm, full tone, and it is no surprise that they are very 
		commonly used for lead roles in many songs. This type of guitar appeals to solo artists as it 
		pairs very well with a variety of instruments, and can easily take the lead role in many pieces.  
		Acoustic guitars may also feature a "pickup" which allows them to connect to an amplifier which 
		makes it much easier for acoustic guitarists to play in large concert halls or open areas. 
        	While acoustic guitars are typically made of wood with steel strings, some newer acoustic guitarists 
		may start off with a plastic guitar with nylon strings. </p> 
		<h3 id="electricguitars"> Electric Guitars </h3> 
		<p> The electric guitar is one of the most iconic instruments in rock and roll music. Its 
		powerful sound and role in music creates a very "cool" atmosphere around electric guitars.
		Electric guitars are often made of plastic and can be very uniquely designed with vibrant colours 
		and unorthodox designs. The design of the electric guitar is very different from the design of the 
		acoustic guitar. They often have a solid plastic body  and are designed to allow access to frets 
		all the way up to the 24th. Electric guitars tend to take the lead role in rock and roll music, 
		while typically taking the role of the accompaniment in most forms of pop music. 	</p> 
		<h3 id="bassguitars"> Bass Guitars </h3> 
		<p> Bass guitars are a type of guitar found most commonly in rock music. They provide the 
		background bassline which unites the sounds of the other instruments in the band. These guitars
		have four thick steel strings stretched across a long neck. These thicker strings are much less tightly
		wound than those of an acoustic or electric guitar, creating a lower pitch.  </p> 
		<h2 id="GuitarRoles"> The Roles of the Guitar in Various Forms of Music </h2>
		<p> The guitar is an instrument that has been a staple for many genres of music for many years.
            	From rock and roll to classical music, guitars are sure to be present and in the limelight. </p> 
		<h2> Pop Music </h2> 
		<p> The role that the guitar often takes in pop music is the lead role. Guitars go very well with
		vocals and because of this, are a very common instrument in pop music. However, electric guitars and 
        	bass guitars are much less commonly found in pop music. </p> 
		<h2> Classical Music </h2> 
		<p> In classical music, the guitar is usually used without any other instruments. Fingerpicking is often
		used in combination with strumming. The types of guitar typically used for classical music usually have 
		nylon strings, along with a layered plywood body. The nylon strings create a softer, more elegant 
		sound than the usual steel strings of an acoustic guitar. </p>
		<h2> Jazz Music </h2> 
		<p> The role of the guitar in jazz music is usually the accompaniment. Acoustic guitars are usually used
		to help create the "chill" mood of the music, rather than taking the lead role. The guitar is a popular
		instrument for jazz music as it is very well suited to the "cool" appeal that jazz music has for
		many of its fans. </p> 	
		<h2> Blues Music </h2> 
		<p> One of the most iconic roles of the guitar is its role in Blues Music. The acoustic guitar is used 
		as on of the main instruments in Blues music, alongside vocals. The guitar works so well with the Blues
		that two guitars are often used. One guitar, typically an acoustic, will lay down the basic chords of the
		song, usually following some version of the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues">  
		"Twelve Bar Blues."</a> The other guitar, (in most cases an electric
		or another acoustic) will play a solo. Many guitar players simply improvise their solos. This is done by
		"noodling" with notes belonging to a scale that suits the chords of the song well </p>
