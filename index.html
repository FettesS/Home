	        <h1 id= "Top"> Overview </h1> 
		<p> Dating back as early as the 1400s, the guitar has been a staple instrument for a vsriety of 
		musical genres. With its iconic look and sound, it is one of the most versatile instruments in the 
		world. Compared to the rest of the string instrument family , the guitar is rather unique. Though 
		it may share a relatively similar design with other string instruments, it is used in very 
		different roles. While the other instruments of the family like the violin and cello are mostly 
		found in orchestral music, the guitar is found in a vast variety of <a href="#GuitarRoles"> music 
		forms </a> ranging from classical to rock and roll </p> 
		<h2 id="GuitarAnatomy"> Anatomy of the Guitar </h2>
		<p> As is the case with all instruments, the guitar is made up of many parts that all come together 
		in a very
		particular way to create the instrument. The guitar is no exception to this trend, it is a finely 
		crafted instrument
		with very precise requirements and measurements. The acoustic guitar is a wooden instrument
		that has 6 steel strings stretching along a long wooden panel called the neck. The neck of the 
		average acoustic steel string guitar stretches for approximately 24 inches. The neck is divided
		into 24 frets. Each set of 12 frets accounts for 1 octave of the guitar. On most guitars, only the 
		first 12 frets are accessible. However, some guitars may feature a "cut-in." Cut-ins are when a 
		guitar is built with a section of the body removed so that the player can move their hand farther 
		up the fretboard and access all 24 frets. At the top of the neck is the headstock. On the headstock 
		is where the strings' tuning pegs are found. These pegs allow for each string to be tuned
		individually by tightening the string (raising the pitch), or loosening the string (lowering the 
		pitch). Once a string begins to vibrate, the sound is magnified by the hollow wooden or plastic body 
		of the guitar. The sound produced is projected out of the body through a hole called the sound hole.
		The sound hole is found at the opposite end of the fretboard as the headstock.</p>  	
		<h2 id="GuitarTypes"> Types of Guitars </h2> 
		<p> To accommodate for its large variety of roles in music, the guitar also comes in a variety of 
		types, each one having its own unique sound and feel. The types are as follows: </p> 
		<ul> 
		    <li> <a href= "#acousticguitars"> Acoustic Guitars </a> </li> 
		    <li> <a href= "#electricguitars"> Electric Guitars </a> </li> 
		    <li> <a href= "#bassguitars"> Bass Guitars </a> </li> 
		</ul> 
		<h3 id="acousticguitars"> Acoustic guitars </h3> 
		<p> Acoustic guitars are the type of guitar most commonly found playing lead roles in country,
		or pop music. These guitars produce a warm, full tone, and it is no surprise that they are very 
		commonly used for lead roles in many songs. This type of guitar appeals to solo artists as it 
		pairs very well with a variety of instruments, and can easily take the lead role in many pieces  
		Acoustic guitars may also feature a "pickup" which allows them to connect to an ampliyer which 
		makes it much easier for acoustic guitarists to play in large concert halls or open areas. 
		<h3 id="electricguitars"> Electric Guitars </h3> 
		<p> The electric guitar is one of the most iconic instruments in rock and roll music. Its 
		iconic sound and role in music creates a very "cool" atmosphere around electric guitars.
		Electric guitars are often made of plastic and can be very uniquely designed with vibrant colours 
		and unorthodox designs. The design of the electric guitar is very different from the design of the 
		acoustic guitar. They often have a solid plastic body  and are designed to allow access to frets 
		all the way up to the 24th. Electric guitars tend to take the lead role in rock and roll music, 
		while typically taking the role of the accompaniment in most forms of pop music. 	</p> 
		<h3 id="bassguitars"> Bass Guitars </h3> 
		<p> Bass guitars are a type of guitar found most commonly in rock music. They provide the 
		background bassline which unites the sounds of the other instruments in the band. These guitars
		have 4 thick steel strings stretched across a long neck. These thicker strings are much less tightly
		wound than those of an acoustic or electric guitar, creating a lower pitch. </p> 
		<h2 id="GuitarRoles"> The Roles of the Guitar in Various Forms of Music </h2>
		<p> The guitar is an instrument that has been a staple for many genres of music for many years.
            From rock and roll to classical music, guitars are sure to be present and in the limelight. </p> 
		<h2> Playing Techniques </h2> 
		<p> Following in suit with the types of guitars and types of music featuring guitars, 
		there is also a variety of playing techniques that lend themselves well to different roles 
		in music. </p>
		<h3> "Fingerstyle Guitar" </h3> 
		<p> Fingerstyle guitar is a style of guitar playing popular among solo artists. This is because 
		it attempts to incorporate both the accompaniment and lead parts of a song into one instrument.
		This is done by changing notes of chords in the song to include melody notes in every chord change.
		Fingerstyle guitar also often includes the percussion aspect of songs as well. Fingerstyle
		guitarists often include the percussion by slapping the strings of the guitar, creating a higher
		pitched tone similar to that of a snare drum. Players can also use lower percussion sounds by
		hitting their wrist on the wood of the guitar above the tone hole. The combination of all of these
		techniques makes fingerstyle guitar a very unique and interesting guitar technique to use </p> 
		<h3> Finger Picking </h3>
		<p> Finger picking is a guitar technique often used in classical guitar music. The player picks 
		individual strings with one finger at a time, often alternating between the index and middle  
		fingers on each note in more simple pieces, or alternating between three or more fingers in more 
		complex pieces. Finger picking can create a very elegant sound when alternating multiple fingers 
		as the notes are played in very close succession, making them flow very nicely. </p>
