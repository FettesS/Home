		<h2> "Fingerstyle Guitar" </h2> 
		<p> <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerstyle_guitar">Fingerstyle guitar</a> 
		is a style of guitar playing popular among solo artists. This is because 
		it attempts to incorporate both the accompaniment and lead parts of a song into one instrument.
		This is done by changing notes of chords in the song to include melody notes in every chord change.
		Fingerstyle guitar also often includes the percussion aspect of songs as well. Players do this by 
		slapping the strings of the guitar, creating a higher
		pitched tone similar to that of a snare drum. Players can also use lower percussion sounds by
		hitting their wrist on the wood of the guitar above the tone hole. The combination of all of these
		techniques makes fingerstyle guitar a very unique and interesting guitar technique to use </p> 
		<h2> Finger Picking </h2>
		<p> Finger picking is a guitar technique often used in classical guitar music. The player picks 
		individual strings with one finger at a time, often alternating between the index and middle  
		fingers on each note in more simple pieces, or alternating between three or more fingers in more 
		complex pieces.</p> 
		<h2> Using a Pick </h2> 
		<p> One of the main guitar playing techniques, using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_pick">
		guitar pick</a> is a very solid technique that can 
		be used in many different styles of music. The guitar pick is used in one of two ways, either it is used
		to strum multiple strings, or to pick individual strings. When picking individual strings with a guitar 
		pick, players often alternate between picking up and down. Familiarizing oneself with the "down-up"
		picking pattern can be very beneficial for guitar players as it allows them to pick quickly and precisely.
		Though strumming may seem like an easier guitar technique than precisely picking individual strings,
		players must also practice to hone their skills in strumming the strings of the guitar. The strumming 
		pattern used by guitar players varies greatly depending on the music being played. For some pieces,
		a simple "down-up" picking pattern is appropriate. In others, any combination of down and up strums may
		be needed to play quickly and efficiently. </p>
